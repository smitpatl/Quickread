# Quickread
Android application to serve stories in the notification drawer

#### Motivation
This app allows the users ubiquitous access to their subscribed feeds.
Userâ€™s personalised feed can be viewed by pulling down the notification drawer even if they are using another app. Even if a process
is active in an ongoing application, the user can browse the articles without
interrupting the activity.
